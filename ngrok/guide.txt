if you haven't installed ngrok, do that from this url

For asp dotnet core applications, first change the project from iis express to the name of your project.

head for the directory having the ngrok.exe program, open the program there and enter the command below
	ngrok http -host-header="localhost:[port]" [port]
For my case, the app website is running on port 5000, and so it is
	ngrok http -host-header="localhost:5000" 5000

thats it, note that for asp dotnet core api defaults in launchsettings file, http is on port 5000 and https is on port 5001
do it, and do other important work.
