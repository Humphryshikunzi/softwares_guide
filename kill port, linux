If you want to kill a process running on port number 8080 then first you need to find the 8080 port process identification number(PID) and then kill it. Run the following command to find 8080 port number PID:

sudo lsof -t -i:8080

Here,
sudo - command to ask admin privilege(user id and password).
lsof - list of files(Also used for to list related processes)
-t - show only process ID
-i - show only internet connections related process
:8080 - show only processes in this port number

So you can now easily kill your PID using following command:

sudo kill -9 <PID>

Here,
kill - command to kill the process
-9 - forcefully

You can use one command to to kill a process on a specific port using the following command:

sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:8080)
